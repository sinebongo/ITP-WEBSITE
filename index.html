                        By addressing the different interests of students, we enhance and improve student engagement.As they have a level of choice in the learning path they take, this sense of ownership will propel students to become invested in their learning journey.

                        A tutor generally earns between R180 and R200 per hour, however we as ITP acknowledge it is absurd to rate so high considering what the world is facing.

                    <p>
                        we therefore rate as little as R150 per month.¯\_( ͡❛ ᴗ ͡❛)_/¯
